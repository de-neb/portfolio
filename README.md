<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

I decided to improved my first portfolio using Vue and after learning the set up for Vue's routes. I think using Vue made my code more readable and organized compared on my first portfolio where I just used pure HTML, CSS and Javascript. Although, I also think that the same could still be achieved if I didn't use any framework like Vue it's just that I'll be seeing probably a lot of HTML elements in my Javascript file. In this version I only used three colors for my color scheme and went for a very simple design. I also added a light and dark theme.

### Built With

- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)
